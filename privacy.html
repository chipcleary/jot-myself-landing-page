        10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
      </p>
      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications
        include a Do-Not-Track ( "DNT" ) feature or setting you can activate
        to signal
        your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
        activities
        monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology
        standard for
        recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized . As
        such, we do not
        currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
        automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If
        a standard
        for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we
        will inform
        you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
